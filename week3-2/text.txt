the 4 ways of authentication are
-> hashing -> converting a single string into a complex gibberish. which cannot be converted back
whenever you signup you give the user name and password then the password is again converted into hash and stored in the database 
-> encryption -- 2 way -- require a key to decrypt
-> jwt - json web tokens -- takes json as the input --- takes the json and creates a long string as an output
